## SUMMARY
--------------------
Software engineer with strong knowledge of and experience with mathematics, electrical engineering, physics, image processing/computer vision, and machine learning.  Experience on many “big” projects, including top secret missile development and the world’s premier fighter jet (F-22 Raptor), as well as cutting edge R&D startup work, including developing the world’s first full-body real time virtual reality combat simulator and a commercially successful golf simulator with motion analysis and “shiny” 3D graphics.

I love technical challenges, but I am a far cry from the kind of thinker who is so enamored with R&D that he seeks to avoid “work.”  I work hard, and I work fast, and I have a reputation for being able to frequently figure out the source of a bug (and then resolve it) before my colleagues can, as well as develop systems “from the ground up.”

I have received steady and significant increases in pay and responsibility over the course of my career, indicating my value to the three companies I have worked for.  Please inquire for strong recommendations from former colleagues and supervisors.

* Developed iOS coloring book entertainment app ColorArtist.
 * Devised and implemented custom edge detection and edge connection algorithm.
Sole developer on all aspects of app, from GUI to image processing algorithms.
Completed Coursera machine learning, iOS development, and Windows mobile online courses.
Covered machine learning topics like Artificial Neural Networks, Convolutional Neural Networks, Support Vector Machine, Linear and Logistic Regression, other popular machine learning algorithms, as well as best practices for implementing these algorithms in software and hardware (e.g., parallel computing and GPUs).
Participated in multiple Kaggle machine learning competitions - Santander Product Recommendation, Dstl Satellite Imagery Feature Detection, MNIST.
Utilized Convolutional Neural Network for Satellite Imagery Feature Detection.  After debugging and improving my code, achieving promising results.
Developed software “by hand” for standard Artificial Neural Network (including backpropogation technique which allows the algorithm to “learn”) for identifying handwritten digits in popular MNIST database.
Developed iOS, android and windows app, ACCA, for a local private high school. (Objective C, Java, C#)

2000-2014.  Fellow at Motion Reality Inc.
Chief architect and software developer for VIRTSIM, a 3D immersive virtual reality military and law enforcement tactical training system.  (C++, UDP, TCP/IP, OpenCV, OpenGL,  pthreads, AI, OGRE, Virtual Reality, Human Motion Capture, Image Processing/Computer Vision) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zx0eoUVzyXE  //www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot1YWjboeF0
Primary developer of system (GUI, data communication, “ballistics” logic, AI logic, etc.) post-motion capture.
Investigated, discovered, and resolved several vexing bugs related to data communication in real-time system.  For example, I discovered that the firmware on the cameras was such that the TCP was set to resend data 3 times when it did not receive an ACK, instead of just giving up after the first failure.  This greatly improved the smoothness of our realtime system.  For another example, I had to weigh the pros of UDP speed with the pros of TCP guarantee-of-transmission, and use one in some cases and one in other cases, considering the real time constraints of our bandwidth-heavy system.
Key developer of motion capture system.
One of two engineers who discovered and fixed the primary cause of “jitters” and “pops” in the motion capture: sub-optimal modeling of radial distortion.  Among other contributions, used R to statistically and visually analyze data, in order to confirm the source of the error and in order to precisely gauge the improvement given by the new radial distortion correction code.
Investigated, discovered, and resolved bugs that prevented our real-time virtual combat simulator from keeping up when 13 men were sprinting in the system at full speed (incorrect extrapolation during frame skipping).
Gained strong familiarity with the biomechanics models of our system, and helped resolve a problem with our model fitting scheme, wherein the Fletcher-Powell optimization would not converge in certain cases.
Manager and software developer for the participation of VIRTSIM in the US Army AEWE Bold Quest exercise at Fort Benning, GA.  Integrated VIRTSIM, via Distributed Interactive Simulation (DIS) protocol, with the Army’s baseline 3D graphics engine.  Conducted real-time tactical training exercise between two VIRTSIM units, one at Fort Benning, GA and the other at Marietta, GA.  http://investor.raytheon.com/phoenix.zhtml?c=84193&p=irol-newsArticle&ID=1749291
Initiated departmental 10 hour days to meet strict deadline.  Received strong commendations from partner Raytheon for the pace of our work.  Resolved coordinate frame relationship problems unknowingly incorrectly solved by Raytheon engineering team.
Our system as a whole was significantly more acclaimed than competing systems by the Army and its participants, from private to general, partly due to our non-nauseating virtual reality, and partly due to the smoothness of our GUI and 3D graphical world. 
Manager and software developer of motion capture based golf training system.  Initially licensed as TaylorMade Golf MAT-T System.  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0ETKO_rVnyM
One of two systems which generated the most revenue/funding for Motion Reality (the other being VIRTSIM).
Principal inventor on patent 9,159,152 - Mapping between a capture volume and a virtual world in a motion capture simulation environment. https://www.google.com/patents/US9159152
Principal inventor on patent 9,311,742 - Navigating an avatar through a virtual world in a motion capture simulation environment. https://www.google.com/patents/US9311742

1987-2000. Software engineer at Lockheed Martin, Marietta, GA.
Developed software to perform testing and verification of the F-22 avionics operating system module. (Perl)
Developed a software suite (one of a 3-man team) to perform both embedded timing tests and timing simulations for the entire F-22 avionics suite.  Developed a language to encode the message interaction between the different F-22 avionics modules and developed two compilers, one to translate the language to actual F-22 code (which we downloaded and executed on F-22 hardware), and the second compiler to translate the language into the input of an off-the-shelf simulation timing tool. (C/C++)
Lead Engineer of the Situation Assessment module for the DARPA Pilot’s Associate Program. Program was an investigation into a computer co-pilot for fighter pilots.  (C/C++) https://trid.trb.org/view.aspx?id=277372

1979-1987. Software engineer at Lockheed, Sunnyvale, CA.
Developed and utilized 3-DOF and 6-DOF simulations for the Guidance and Control group of a major classified avionics program.  (Fortran, Euler Angles, Quaternions, 3-DOF, 6-DOF, AutoPilot)
Assisted in the implementation and analysis of Vector steering algorithms for terminal guidance of vehicle.
Engineer in charge of multiple image processing demonstrations.  Demonstration teams consisted of from 4 to 15 engineers.  One primary demonstration was for the next generation of image processing for the Tomahawk land attack cruise missile program. 
Project included design and development of novel path-following algorithm, generation of 3D terrain map from multiple satellite images, along with the end-to-end prototype demonstration.
Engineer in a major satellite image processing program.
Developed algorithms for automatic segmentation of satellite imagery.
Developed a road following algorithm utilizing satellite imagery.  
Engineer in charge of the Lockheed image processing team to support the Space Shuttle Challenger accident investigation.  Received letter of commendation from President Reagan.
Employed sophisticated photogrammetry techniques to target the precise origin of the explosion.  Worked with second team (i.e., experts in propulsion and spacecrafts) to conclusively determine the cause of the disaster.

1973-1979.  Graduate Teaching Assistant at Auburn University, Auburn, AL.
Taught 2 courses per quarter to Auburn undergraduate students.  Courses covered Precalculus, Calculus I, Calculus II, and Calculus III.
