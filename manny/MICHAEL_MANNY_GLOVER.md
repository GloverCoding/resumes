## PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE
_______________

#### DATA SCIENTIST
##### Stanley Black & Decker **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Atlanta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** June 2018 to January 2019
* Devised two potentially patentable solutions:
  * Using a mobile device (e.g., an iPad) as the chessboard for OpenCV's camera calibration.
  * Using an AprilTag as the ground truth for a pose regression ConvNet, skipping the costly labeling step required in supervised ML approaches to object detection and tracking.
* Invented and developed a pseudo machine learning approach to optimize parameters of OpenCV’s SimpleBlobDetector, to detect blob-like defects in X-ray images of pipeline welds.  (As it turns out, I had just developed a method more or less equivalent to randomized grid search cross validation, found in many data science toolkits.)
* Invented and developed GMM clustering + Snakes algorithm to classify X-ray weld images into five regions.
* Configured environment for lidar+RGB camera calibration.  Had to debug code *within* the open source 3rd party lib to get it working.

#### COMPUTER VISION SOFTWARE ENGINEER
##### MiRus **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Marietta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** August 2016 to January 2018
* Integrated monocular and stereo FLIR and ZED cameras into our system, including their SDKs (e.g., FlyCapture2, StereoLabs)
* Conceived of and developed GUIs/visualizations that led to revelations w.r.t. weakness in our motion tracking algorithms.
* Invented and developed novel method to take advantage of previously unused features of the AprilTag.
* Rebuilt CMake build system from the ground up, including the build automation script that installed our external dependencies (VTK, OpenCV, Qt) to get a new Linux box able to build the code base and run our programs in one click.

#### DATA SCIENCE ASSOCIATE INSTRUCTOR
##### General Assembly **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Atlanta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** May 2016 to August 2016
* Taught full time class that covered various data science topics, including linear and logistic regression, k-NN, random forests (and other ensemble methods), SVMs, regularization (e.g., ridge, lasso), NLP, time series modelling, ANNs, and other techniques.
* Taught in Python (pandas, sklearn, matplotlib, etc).  Other data engineering/data science packages were also covered, albeit lightly (for example, MongoDB, SQL, and PySpark).

#### SOFTWARE ENGINEER
##### Cardlytics **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Atlanta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** December 2014 to May 2016
* Devised and implemented novel method to parse and interpret strings originally derived from point-of-sales systems. These systems were not standardized and required human input, which made the resulting strings highly non-uniform and typo-ridden. Thus, a non-trivial artificial intelligence algorithm was required to correctly classify each “word” in each string. My approach to solving the problem was based on the generic scene identification algorithm, Relaxation Labeling.
* Developed real time bidding platform in C++, in a small scrum team.  Was the lead software engineer of integrating the platform with the BidSwitch exchange.  Attained a solid understanding of a complex system, “the platform”, which was based on the open source RTBKit.  Attained intimate understanding of the complex C++ code that funneled in bid requests extremely efficiently from the external exchange.  Built new exchange connector and kept code in sync with exchanges’ specification documents.  Built performance-optimized filters that required low-level understanding, including bit shifting.

#### COMPUTER VISION SOFTWARE INTERN
##### Beena Vision **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Norcross, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** August 2014 to November 2014
* Devised and implemented novel algorithm to identify train brakes in 2D grayscale images. Invented a novel data visualization for my algorithm’s data and built a GUI around it.

#### COMPUTER VISION SOFTWARE ENGINEER
##### Motion Reality **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Marietta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** March 2010 to February 2014
* Designed and developed software, in C++, for an optical motion capture system where the end appliction was an immersive real time virtual reality system, utilized for tactical combat training. Served as the responsible engineer of the tracking and identification phases of the motion capture. Designed and implemented new techniques and improved current methods that greatly increased the reliability of the product (see points below).
* Independently researched, designed, and implemented new first-frame identification algorithm, based on the generic scene identification technique, Relaxation Labeling. Improved initial identification success rate from 50% to 98%.
* Designed and implemented new techniques to address mistracking issues, caused by marker occlusion and noise markers, without which full-squadron captures at 60 Hz would not have been possible.
* Worked with various mathematical techniques relevant to the motion capture product, including computer vision scene labeling techniques (Relaxation, Auction), multivariate optimization (Fletcher-Powell), point triangulation, moving object forecasting, and linear regression.
* Explored various advanced mathematical techniques, while researching potential solutions to technical problems. These techniques included the Kalman Filter, the Hough Transform, K-Means Clustering, Principal Components Analysis, Levenberg-Marquardt, Simulated Annealing, Ant Colony Optimization (and other Swarm Intelligence algorithms), ANNs, Self-Organizing Maps, Expectation Maximization, Bootstrapping, HMMs, Monte Carlo and Evolutionary Algorithms.

#### ECONOMIC FORECASTING INTERN
##### Siemens AG **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Alpharetta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** May 2009 to August 2009
* Assisted lead forecaster in the strategic planning department of a multi-billion-dollar division of Siemens. Used my knowledge of statistics and forecasting to clarify modeling issues with management. 
* Developed software in Visual Basic for Applications to streamline data collection and analysis processes with Excel: automated numerous tedious tasks.

#### GRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANT
##### Georgia Tech School of Economics **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Atlanta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** August 2008 to December 2009
* Taught quantitative economics recitation sessions, including Economic Forecasting, Econometrics, and Probability and Statistics.
* Substituted in main lecture several times for professors and received strong compliments from students regarding my teaching abilities.
* Assisted professors occasionally in economic analysis projects using statistical analysis software Stata and Excel.

#### UNDERGRADUATE TEACHING ASSISTANT
##### Georgia Tech School of Mathematics **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** Atlanta, GA **&nbsp;&#167;&nbsp;** August 2007 to December 2007
* Taught Survey of Calculus recitation sessions to Business / Economics / Accounting / Public Policy freshmen.
* My interviewer, a mathematics PhD candidate, said that I explained better than he could the concept of a maximum or minimum of a function corresponding to where the derivative of the function equals zero.
